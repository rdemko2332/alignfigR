# alignfigR
NEW and IMPROVED alignfigR written by R. T. Demko and S. J. Spielman
* Redid extract_subalign() in a tidyverse framework
* Made sure to comment out the code
* Added multiple palettes to define_palette such as "Ocean", "Forest", "Fire" and "Floral"
* Readded clist and cexcl functionality to extract_subalign(). You can now specify taxa, columns, and if you wish to include or exclude them
